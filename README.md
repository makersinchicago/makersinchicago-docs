### Managing the Data

Currently, the data lives throughout markdown files in the directory folder.
The categories are managed by folders. Creating a markdown file in a folder will list a new organization categorized as the named of that folder. Creating a new folder would create a new category.

The markdown files contain metadeta for the organizations and should follow this pattern:

'''
title:  
address:  
tags:  
site:  
summary:  
```

Organization with multiple locations should leave the adress off.
