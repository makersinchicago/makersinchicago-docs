### Managing the Data

Currently, the data lives throughout markdown files in the directory folder. Folders manage the categories. Creating a markdown file in a folder will list a new organization categorized as that folder's name. Creating a new folder would create a new category. The markdown files contain metadata for the organizations and should follow this pattern:

```
title:  
address:  
tags:  
site:  
summary:  
```

Organizations with multiple locations should leave the address off.
