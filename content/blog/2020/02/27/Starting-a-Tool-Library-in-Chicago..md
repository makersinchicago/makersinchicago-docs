Wednesday, the Chicago Public Library hosted the Chicago Tool Library at the Harold Washington Library Center. The talk was presented by Co-Founders Tessa Videk and Jim Benton. Launched in the summer of 2019, The Chicago Tool Library is Chicagoâ€™s first community tool lending library. Their mission is to provide equitable access to tools, equipment, and information to alow _all_ Chicagoans to learn, share, and create. Tonight, they shared their story and strides to promote the idea of access over ownership and a circular economy.

## Core Values and Goals

 At their core, the organization is guided by their values in promoting equity, sustainability, community, and individual growth.

To make the concept accessible to all and to help Chicagoans start their own tool libraries across the city, they have laid out set of goals for themselves as reminders througought their work.

## A History on Tool Libraries

The [first tool library](https://www.dispatch.com/article/20091018/lifestyle/310189765) opened in Columbus, Ohio. Originally maintained by the city as the Columbus Tool Library, it was handed over to a nonprofit called Rebuilding Together and is now called Modcon Living's Tool Library's.

Community Tool Libraries can can now be found all over the world. Thankfully for Chicago, Tessa and Ben bring prior experiences with Tool Libraries in other cities and were inspired to get the city pinned on the map.

### Another Tessa

Tessa Kelso, sixth City Librarian of LA, held ambitious goals for the future of libraries where they were the epicenter for learning and access. She's featured in _The Library Book_ by Susan Orlean.

[book excerpts]

> Digression: I read this last year and would absolutely recommend it, it's a story about the love for libraries and a tragic fire that was overshadowed on the news cycle by Chernobyl. After reading, it made me feel bad that I bought it instead of borrowing it from @chipublib.

Tool Libraries are often independent of public libraries, but they both serve as centers for empowering the community and fostering learning. Many traditional libraries now do lend non-book materials including a selection tools. E.g. @chipublib loans out fishing roads and robots.

For the next few slides, we got a view of Chicago orgs and other Tool Libraries that helped out during their research phase, survey demographics, and their earliest volunteers. I see many @makersinchicago friends in the first image.

They had a BIG and busy 2019 with a crowdfunding campaign, tool drives, fundraising, and a grand opening! 3/4ths of all current tools were acquired during drives and now have a current inventory size is about 1k. Initially just the two of them, now they have about twenty volunteers.

## Challenges

0: What elements from existing tool libraries should be incorporated / Solve by not solving

1: Chicago is huge! Chicago is the biggest city with a tool library / Try to be centralized but don't stress it too much 

2: Chicago is expensive / Ask for help!

3: Tool donations are a lot of work / Be more selective

Initially, all donations are great but eventually, you get way too many.

4: Numbering hand tools is tedious / Stop doing it, make classes. A-112 is a screwdriver; power tools have individual numbers.

5: No comprehensive software for tool lending libraries, current ILS systems are not optimized for their specific needs / Build it yourself (and make it open-source!). It allows full customization like including preferred pronouns.

6: Personal information is a liability/ Collect as little as possible, use anonymous surveys, etc.

7: Tools might not come back / For the most part, they do ðŸ˜„. Focus on constructive efforts.

## Basics

To be a member: be 18 yrs old, live in Chicago, sign a membership agreement, pay a sliding scale membership fee, have fun!

Rules: A max of 7 tools at a time, a 7-day tool loan, renewals depend on demand for specific tools, no late fees (following @chipublib).

> In thinking abut what the space would be, we really focused on the experience of a regular library... We think it's cool that people come in and are honest about their shortcomings with tools and want to skill up. - CTL

They talked a lot on accessibilty and being non-punitive.

They have members in 42 zip codes in Chicago! I'm one of the 1 member zips and I have a guess about a neighboring zip member.

## Q&A

Q1: Consumables and maintenance, how do you handle them?

A: If we have the consumables then you can have them, repairs are on us.

Q2: What if an individual doesn't have space to utilize the tools?

A: Our goal is to supply tools, we do have a resource index where you might find space to use them.

Q3: What tools do you need?

A: Our site has a donate page with guidelines, what we don't want, and a request list.

See here: https://chicagotoollibrary.org/donate

Q4: Are you concerned about liability of sharp tools.

A: We have a liability form sign up for that reason.

> There wasn't any incidents they mentioned

At sign up there is also documentation suggesting that you should know how to use a borrowed tool and will exercise caution.

Q5: What's your biggest growth challenges.

A: Outreach and building partnerships with community members and organizations who haven't found us yet.

A2: We'd like to make our space more accessible to people's schedules with more days. We're currently open 8 hours a week.

Q6: What tool are surprised by their popularity

A: Sewing Machines and clamps of all sizes.

Q7: How would you compare the accessibility of your tool library to others. Are all of them as focus on accessibility as you and non-punitive?

A: The structures are different across the board but we think being punitive doesn't help to make us comforting or welcoming to all.

## Closing
