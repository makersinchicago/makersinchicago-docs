Launched in the summer of 2019, The Chicago Tool Library is Chicagoâ€™s first community tool lending library. Their mission is to provide equitable access to tools, equipment, and information to allow _all_ Chicagoans to learn, share, and create.

On a sunny Wednesday in February, Co-Founders Tessa Videk and Jim Benton shared their story and strives to promote the idea of access over ownership and a circular economy. The presentation was held in the Video Theater of the Harold Washington Library Center. Here's what the crowd learned about.

At their core, the organization is guided by its values in promoting equity, sustainability, community, and individual growth. This is how they've defined that:

EQUITY
: When tool access is limited by your ability to purchase, there is inequity around who is able to change and repair neighborhoods and who is allowed to create. Tool libraries allow everyone to access tools regardless of income.

SUSTAINABILITY
: Most of us do not use our tools often enough to necessitate purchasing new. By sharing tools we reduce the manufacturing footprint of tools and divert unwanted tools from landfills and, instead, put them into the hands of thousands of community members.

COMMUNITY
: To borrow you need to be a part of a community. Many in our city are not members of a community with access to valuable assets or resources. We are creating that community for all of our neighbors.

GROWTH
: With resources we are able to improve our lives, our homes, and our city.  By creating equitable access to tools we hope to create new opportunities for Chicagoans to grow.

To make the concept accessible to all and to help Chicagoans start their own tool libraries across the city, they've laid out set of goals for themselves as reminders throughout their work. They hope their members will take ownership of these as well to get the most out of their experience.

COST
: Purchasing and maintaining tools is expensive, but borrowing them is not. Our memberships are priced on a sliding scale to ensure nobody is unable to access our resources due to their financial status.  

SPACE   
: Having the space to store tool collections is a luxury most city-dwellers cannot afford. Becoming a member of a tool library means you have access to hundreds of tools without needing to store them in your own home.

KNOWLEDGE
: A tool library is more than its inventory, it is a space for learning. We welcome anyone to visit the library to share your questions, problems, and solutions with our growing community. We will also grow capacity for training, programming, and workshops.

CONFIDENCE
: Borrowing tools allows you to experiment! When you donâ€™t have to purchase an expensive tool you can build skills and confidence at your own pace and your own budget.

The [first tool library](https://www.dispatch.com/article/20091018/lifestyle/310189765) opened in Columbus, Ohio. Originally maintained by the city as the Columbus Tool Library, it was handed over to a nonprofit called Rebuilding Together and is now called Modcon Living's Tool Library's. Community Tool Libraries can now be found all over the world. While Chicago has not been formally pinned, [localtools.org](https://localtools.org/find/) has compiled an international list of them.

While tool libraries are often independent of public libraries, but they both serve as centers for empowering the community and fostering learning. Many traditional libraries now do lend non-book materials sometimes including a selection of tools. Select Chicago Public Library locations also loan out [fishing roads](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/565862126), [robots](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1578527126), [Chromebooks](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1676260126 ), and more.

> There was a short mention of [Tessa Kelso](https://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/blogs/lapl/tessa-kelso-sinful-city-librarian), sixth City Librarian of LA, who held ambitious goals for the future of libraries where they were the epicenter for learning and access. She's featured in [_The Library Book_](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2038863126) by Susan Orlean. I read it last year and would absolutely recommend it. It's a story about the love for libraries and a tragic fire that was overshadowed as the news cycle was focused on Chernobyl.

## The Basics

To be a member at the Chicago Tool Library, there are some simple prerequisites. The first one, be 18 years or older. You must also live within Chicago city limits. Sorry, suburban peeps. One must also sign a membership agreement and pay a membership fee. The thing about the fee is set on a sliding scale. They want individuals to pay want they can and to set for themselves how much they can afford. They recommend that you pay $1 per every $1,000 you earn annually but it is not mandated that you follow this structure. They are really paving the path of financial accessibility. The last thing, like many other spaces, is to have fun!

Lending is an extended transition where someone is granted the use of something with the agreement that is should be returned. Thus, there are some rules for equitable use. One can have a max of seven tools out at a time. The loan period is seven days. Renewals depend on demand for specific tools so call ahead if you need extra time. When they opened, they did have late fees. It was a dollar per day. However, in the wake of Chicago Public Library removing their late fees altogether, Chicago Tool Library decided that they should follow suit. A great change of policy and one that aligns with their non-punitive policies. They acknowledged that late fees are a large point of revenue for libraries and it was something they intended to rely on. In turn, what this means is that they must continuously seek out new sources of funds for sustainability.

A big point of discussion was about accessibility and being non-punitive. The organization wants to empower people. They could have approached that in a variety of ways but starting this tool library certainly differentiates them and brings a great resource to the city.

> In thinking about what the space would be, we really focused on the experience of a regular library... We think it's cool that people come in and are honest about their shortcomings with tools and want to skill up. - CTL

## Challenges

Just like any organization or project of this scale, there are challenges you plan for and some you look reflect on as you progress. They shared some of their most important concerns from their early days.

Both founders have had prior experiences with tool libraries. Naturally, the first question was to figure out what worked. What elements from existing tool libraries should be incorporated here in Chicago? The decision was to, "Solve by not solving." If they tried to solve everything upfront, they would cement themselves in positions that might make it difficult to adjust for later.

Chicago is huge! Chicago is the biggest city with a tool library. It would be great to serve every resident but it is almost impossible. So they attempted to be centralized but didn't stress it too much. Public transit would be ideal but once they found a space with a landlord that shared a similar philosophy, they took the space.

Chicago is expensive... So they asked for help! Fundraisers, Fundraisers, Fundraisers.

Tool donations are a lot of work. This is one they learned along the way. They adjusted by being more selective. Initially, all donations are great but eventually, you get way too many.

Numbering hand tools is tedious. So they stopped doing it and made classes of tools instead. A-112 is a screwdriver; power tools have individual numbers.

There was no comprehensive software for tool lending libraries. Current library software systems are not optimized for their specific needs. They decided to build it themselves (and make it open-source!). It allows full customization like including preferred pronouns.

Recognizing that personal information is a liability. They decided to collect as little as possible.

There the usual library thing that Tools might not come back. This one is a given. Still, they discovered that for the most part, they do ðŸ˜„. They instead focus on constructive efforts.

## A BIG 2019

In 2019; they had a crowdfunding campaign, tool drives, fundraising, and a grand opening! It was in these earlier days that they acquired about 75% of all current tools. They have a current inventory size of about a thousand tools. Initially it just the two of them, Tessa and Jim. They currently have about twenty volunteers. During this time they had a lot of help during their research phase from other Chicago organizations and other Tool Libraries alike. They shared their early demographic survey data and photos of some of their volunteers.

Before closing, there was a Q&A. The seven questions and responses are listed below. As the event wrapped up, a crowd member suggested everyone check out the [Hand Tool Rescue](https://www.youtube.com/user/erzzi6/videos) channel on YouTube.

And finally, a reminder that their [Repair Fair 2.0](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/events/5e46da4adf5923450046bf02) is coming up next month, March 21st 1-4pm at the Bridgeport Library.
