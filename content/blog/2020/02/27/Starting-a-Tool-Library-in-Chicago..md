Launched in the summer of 2019, The Chicago Tool Library is Chicagoâ€™s first community tool lending library. Their mission is to provide equitable access to tools, equipment, and information to alow _all_ Chicagoans to learn, share, and create.

On a sunny Wednesday in February, the Chicago Public Library hosted them for presentation at the Harold Washington Library Center. Co-Founders Tessa Videk and Jim Benton shared their story and strides to promote the idea of access over ownership and a circular economy. The presenation was held in HWLC's Video Theater in the Lower Level. A crowd that was just under twenty showed up, four of which were CTL volunteers. This article will cover what they shared as well as some of my past experience with them.

## Core Values and Goals

At their core, the organization is guided by their values in promoting equity, sustainability, community, and individual growth. This is how they've define that:

EQUITY
: When tool access is limited by your ability to purchase, there is inequity around who is able to change and repair neighborhoods and who is allowed to create. Tool libraries allow everyone to access tools regardless of income.

SUSTAINABILITY
: Most of us do not use our tools often enough to necessitate purchasing new. By sharing tools we reduce the manufacturing footprint of tools and divert unwanted tools from landfills and, instead, put them into the hands of thousands of community members.

COMMUNITY
: To borrow you need to be a part of a community. Many in our city are not members of a community with access to valuable assets or resources. We are creating that community for all of our neighbors. 

GROWTH
: With resources we are able to improve our lives, our homes, and our city.  By creating equitable access to tools we hope to create new opportunities for Chicagoans to grow.

To make the concept accessible to all and to help Chicagoans start their own tool libraries across the city, they have laid out set of goals for themselves as reminders throughout their work. They hope their members will share these to get the most out of their experience.

COST
: Purchasing and maintaining tools is expensive, but borrowing them is not. Our memberships are priced on a sliding scale to ensure nobody is unable to access our resources due to their financial status.  

SPACE
: Having the space to store tool collections is a luxury most city-dwellers cannot afford. Becoming a member of a tool library means you have access to hundreds of tools without needing to store them in your own home. 

KNOWLEDGE
: A tool library is more than its inventory, it is a space for learning. We welcome anyone to visit the library to share your questions, problems, and solutions with our growing community. We will also grow capacity for training, programming, and workshops. 

CONFIDENCE
: Borrowing tools allows you to experiment! When you donâ€™t have to purchase an expensive tool you can build skills and confidence at your own pace and your own budget.

## A History on Tool Libraries

The [first tool library](https://www.dispatch.com/article/20091018/lifestyle/310189765) opened in Columbus, Ohio. Originally maintained by the city as the Columbus Tool Library, it was handed over to a nonprofit called Rebuilding Together and is now called Modcon Living's Tool Library's.

Community Tool Libraries can can now be found all over the world. Thankfully for Chicago, Tessa and Ben bring prior experiences with Tool Libraries in other cities. Jim served on the board and as President of the Southeast Portland Library. When Tessa  --- at ---. It was Tessa's idea to bring Tool Libraries to Chicago and get the city pinned on the Tool Library map.

### Another Tessa

Tessa Kelso, sixth City Librarian of LA, held ambitious goals for the future of libraries where they were the epicenter for learning and access. She's featured in _The Library Book_ by Susan Orlean.

> ___Digression:___ I read _The Library Book_ by Susan Orlean last year which features a section on Kelso and would absolutely recommend it, it's a story about the love for libraries and a tragic fire that was overshadowed as the news cycle focused on Chernobyl. After reading, it made me feel bad that I bought it instead of borrowing it from Chicago Public Library. ![The Library Book](/images/articles/ctlatcpl/book.png)

Tool Libraries are often independent of public libraries, but they both serve as centers for empowering the community and fostering learning. Many traditional libraries now do lend non-book materials including a selection tools. E.g. @chipublib loans out fishing roads and robots.

For the next few slides, we got a view of Chicago orgs and other Tool Libraries that helped out during their research phase, survey demographics, and their earliest volunteers. I see many @makersinchicago friends in the first image.

They had a BIG and busy 2019 with a crowdfunding campaign, tool drives, fundraising, and a grand opening! 3/4ths of all current tools were acquired during drives and now have a current inventory size is about 1k. Initially just the two of them, now they have about twenty volunteers.

## Challenges

Just like any organization or project of this scale, there are challages you plan for and some you look back on as you progress. Let's take a look at what they shared.

**What elements from existing tool libraries should be incorporated**

Solve by not solving

**Chicago is huge! Chicago is the biggest city with a tool library**

Try to be centralized but don't stress it too much 

**Chicago is expensive**

Ask for help!

**Tool donations are a lot of work**

Be more selective. Initially, all donations are great but eventually, you get way too many.

**Numbering hand tools is tedious.**

Stop doing it, make classes. A-112 is a screwdriver; power tools have individual numbers.

**No comprehensive software for tool lending libraries, current ILS systems are not optimized for their specific needs**

Build it yourself (and make it open-source!). It allows full customization like including preferred pronouns.

**Personal information is a liability.**

Collect as little as possible, use anonymous surveys, etc.

**Tools might not come back.**

For the most part, they do ðŸ˜„. Focus on constructive efforts.


## Basics

To be a member: be 18 yrs old, live in Chicago, sign a membership agreement, pay a sliding scale membership fee, have fun!

Rules: A max of 7 tools at a time, a 7-day tool loan, renewals depend on demand for specific tools, no late fees. When they initially open, they did have late fees. I paid $7 myself but felt fine with such a fee. In the wake of Chicago Public Library removing their late fees, Chicago Tool Library decided that they should follow suit. It was a great change of policy and one that would align with their aim to be as accessible as possible. They acknowledge that late fees are a large point of revenue for lbraries and it ws something they intended to rely on. In turn what this means is that they must continously seek out new sources of funds for sustainability.

> In thinking abut what the space would be, we really focused on the experience of a regular library... We think it's cool that people come in and are honest about their shortcomings with tools and want to skill up. - CTL

They talked a lot on accessibilty and being non-punitive.

They have members in 42 zip codes in Chicago! I'm one of the 1 member zips and I have a guess about a neighboring zip member.

## Q&A

At the presentation, there were 7 questions and a comment. I've left the comment out, question time is for questions, come up and talk to presenters for comments, you take up everyone's time. I would also like to add that the  

- Consumables and maintenance, how do you handle them?
    - If we have the consumables then you can have them, repairs are on us.

- What if an individual doesn't have space to utilize the tools?
    - Our goal is to supply tools, we do have a resource index where you might find space to use them.

Q3: What tools do you need?

A: Our site has a donate page with guidelines, what we don't want, and a request list.

See here: https://chicagotoollibrary.org/donate

Q4: Are you concerned about liability of sharp tools.

A: We have a liability form sign up for that reason.

> There wasn't any incidents they mentioned

At sign up there is also documentation suggesting that you should know how to use a borrowed tool and will exercise caution.

Q5: What's your biggest growth challenges.

A: Outreach and building partnerships with community members and organizations who haven't found us yet.

A2: We'd like to make our space more accessible to people's schedules with more days. We're currently open 8 hours a week.

Q6: What tool are surprised by their popularity

A: Sewing Machines and clamps of all sizes.

Q7: How would you compare the accessibility of your tool library to others. Are all of them as focus on accessibility as you and non-punitive?

A: The structures are different across the board but we think being punitive doesn't help to make us comforting or welcoming to all.

## Closing

As the event wraps us, a crowd member suggests you check out the Hand Tool Rescue channel on YouTube.
